Information on the future plans and roadmap for Curry is sparse and not widely publicized, as the language is primarily a research-oriented tool developed by niche programming communities. Recent updates, like PAKCS 3.8.0 and KiCS2 3.3.0, showcase ongoing efforts to refine the language, but specific strategies for addressing major shortcomings—such as complexity, limited tooling, and performance challenges—are unclear. The active Curry community frequently discusses improvements through mailing lists and forums, which suggests a commitment to its development. For the latest updates, engaging with the official Curry website and community discussions is essential.
