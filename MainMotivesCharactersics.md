Purpose: To describe the Main Motives and Charactersics of the Curry language (including paradigms and typing disciplines)  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
Paradigm(s):
Curry is a declarative multi-paradigm programming language that combines features from functional programming, logic programming, and concurrent programming.  
  
From functional programming it takes; nested expressions, higher-order functions, strong typing, and lazy evaluation  
  
From logic programming it takes; non-determinism, built-in search, free variables, and partial data structures.  
  
From concurrent programming it takes; concurrent evaluation of constraints with synchronization on logical variables.  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
Typing Discipline(s):  
The typing discipline of a language is defined by the nature of type constraints and the way they are evaluated and enforced. The typing discipline originates from practical issues of computer architecture, compiler implementation and language design.  
  
Curry uses strong typing its implementation of functional programming  
Strong typing usually means that the programming language specifies some restrictions on intermixing operations on different data types.  
This is one of the most controversial terms within typing domain, as is has no commonly agreed-upon meaning and different authors use it in different contexts (Strong typing is the opposite of weak typing).  
  
"Curry is strongly typed but type annotations of functions need not be written by the programmer: they are automatically inferred by the compiler using a type inference algorithm. Nevertheless, it is a good style to write down the types of functions in order to provide at least a minimal documentation of the intended use of functions."

Main Motive(s):  
Curry is a declarative programming language, an implementation of the functional logic programming paradigm, and based on the Haskell language.  
Its motive is an international initiative intended to provide a common platform for the research, teaching and application of integrated functional logic languages.  
  
Curry is a universal programming language aiming at the amalgamation of the most important declarative programming paradigms, namely functional programming and logic programming.    
  
Curry has been successfully applied to teach functional and logic programming techniques in a single course without switching between different programming languages
