Purpose: To explain the shortcomings of the CURRENT VERSION of the Curry language
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
  
Curry, while powerful, has notable shortcomings.  
  
Its integration of functional and logic paradigms makes it complex to learn and implement, with compilers and interpreters often struggling with performance.  
  
The ecosystem is small, with limited libraries and tools, which can hinder large projects.  
  
Non-determinism and constraint solving, though useful, can lead to inefficiencies.  
  
Additionally, the lack of standardization and widespread use creates portability and consistency challenges, limiting its practical appeal despite its unique capabilities.
